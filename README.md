# Eastern Europe Marketing Site

This repository contains a static landing page that showcases the Eastern Europe Marketing platform.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory.
2. Start a local static server (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
3. Open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html to view the site.

You can also open `index.html` directly in the browser without starting a server.

## Development tips

* Edit `index.html` and refresh the browser to preview your changes.
* If you prefer automatic reloads, use any static-site dev server (e.g. `npm install -g serve` then run `serve .`).
